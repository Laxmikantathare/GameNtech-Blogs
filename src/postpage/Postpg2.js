    <p>The story is set in a fictionalized representation of the United States in 1899 and follows the exploits of outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, who must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The game is presented through first- and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive open world. Gameplay elements include shootouts, robberies, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters, etc. <p>Red Dead Redemption 2's world features different landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife, and urban settlements ranging from farmhouses to towns and cities.</p></p>
    
    <p> <mark>Things you need to know about Read Dead Redemption 2</mark></p>
    <p><p><strong> It’s visually impressive.</strong></p>
      Red Dead Redemption 2 shows that Rockstar has mastered the PS4 hardware. After all, it’s the studio’s first title natively designed for this generation. The HDR and volumetric lighting bring the game’s sweeping exteriors to life. And the boosted resolution highlights subtle details, from the rough bark on trees to grass shoots peeking out of the snow.</p>
    <p><strong>There are multiple camera settings.</strong></p>
    <p>Activate Cinematic camera angles that toggle between dramatic close-range and panoramic shots as you ride the open plains. Hold down X as you ride in this view, and your horse will keep to the track, allowing you to take in some stunning views on epic rides.
    New cinematic techniques are also used for seamless transitions between cutscenes and gameplay.</p>
    <p><p><strong>You can customize the in-game HUD.</strong></p>Press down on the d-pad to toggle between several different HUD options: off, a minimized version, and the default setting. On the radar, you can easily identify story beats by the yellow icons, while emergent “ambient” events are marked in white.</p>

    <p><p><strong>Fire a warning shot to get attention.</strong></p>Sometimes you won’t want or need to cause unnecessary trouble. While aiming, tap up on the d-pad to fire a warning shot. Handy for intimidating a witness, or causing a carriage to stop so you can climb aboard or simply chat with the driver.</p>
    <p><p><strong>Small talk can lead to outsized consequences.</strong></p>There’s more to interacting with this world than just drawing a weapon. When approaching another person, you can hold L2 to pull up a menu of interactions. A greeting can trigger pleasant exchanges, awkward replies… or could provoke a brawl if your counterpart enjoys his privacy. Engaging with townspeople or fellow travelers adds color and unpredictability to the game. You never know what reaction you’ll get.</p>

    <p><p><strong>Your horse is your partner, but you’ll need to earn its trust.</strong></p>Horses aren’t treated as expendable vehicles here, but as living, breathing creatures with individual temperaments. They provide more than transport: they can carry animal skins and carcasses, as well as extra weapons and gear. To build trust with a new horse, you’ll want to tread lightly — patting it until it’s comfortable in your presence.</p>

    <p><p><strong>The wildlife is diverse and unpredictable.</strong></p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is seething with life, from snakes and swallowtails to deer, skunk, bear, and Lord knows what else. And the creatures engage with each other: during our demo, a hawk soared down to pluck a snake from a nearby bush. It was a dynamic event triggered by the game’s AI, not some scripted sequence.</p>

    <p><p><strong>The soundtrack is dynamic.</strong></p>The rich epic score is being led by returning composer Woody Jackson and a range of guests artists across the game. The game’s soundtrack features approximately 190 individual music pieces, and in the open world, the dynamic score subtly changes based on your actions.</p>
    <p><p><strong>Expect wide environmental diversity.</strong></p>As you play, you’ll traverse snowed-in mountains, agoraphobia-inducing plains, gloomy swamps, and bustling frontier towns. The game seamlessly transitions between wide outdoor vistas into detail-rich interiors, a technical achievement rarely seen.</p>
